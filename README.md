## Modernizing Moving Up the Stack Workshop APIs


This is an helper repo to store microservice code for the Modernizing Moving Up the Tech Stack Workshop. 

Please see the [Main Repo](https://github.com/aws-samples/moving-up-stack-workshop) for details. 

**Please Note** In this example, we use different branches to store the microservice code. This is to simplify the workshop only. Best practice is to store each microservice in its own repository.
